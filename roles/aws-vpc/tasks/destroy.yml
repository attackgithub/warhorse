# First task : creating the VPC.
# We are using the variables set in the vars.yml file.
# The module gives us back its result,
# which contains information about our new VPC. 
# We register it in the variable my_vpc.

# We now use the set_fact module 
# to save the id of the VPC in a new variable.

# Creating our only Subnet in the VPC.
# A subnet needs to be located in an Availability Zone (or AZ).
# Again, we register the results in a variable for later.

# Now we set up a Route Table. 
# We attach that Route Table to the Public Subnet.
# The route we create here defines the default routing 
# of the table, redirecting requests to the Internet Gateway. 
# We don't see it here, but the route table will also contain 
# a route for resources inside the VPC, so that if we need 
# to reach an internal resource, we don't go to the Internet
# Gateway.
